# ExampleFragment

This is an Example Fragment that works with an adapter to display a large list of images, videos, and audio files. It handles various touch gestures using custom classes. The grid view will animate and scale to desired size on pinch zoom in and out. This Fragment handles data from a DDP subscription. If the user isn't scrolling it will prefetch the thumbnail bitmaps head of the visible items on the list on the background thread.The data coming in from the DDP subscription is added to the DataBase on the background thread. If the data is needed in the list it will then be added to objectListSync and the adapter will be notified. This Fragment gets it's data from the database not the data coming in from the DDP subscription directly. In the DB it has the best thumbs for the current state of the app. Even if new thumbs are coming in it will only update if it's needed. If there was locally create assets it will verify they still exist. If not the data will be updated in Realm and default to the servers data if present. I have added other classes directly into this Fragment class that I normally would not for sake of showing the example. I have kept the variable names and class names as generic as 
possible.
